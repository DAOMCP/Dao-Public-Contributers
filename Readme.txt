This is the public repo where we’ll be posting shared assets and collaborating with DAO contributors and the wider community.

We’ve made our website live and fully functional to give the community a clear signal: we’re actively building. It’s proof of progress and commitment—real work, not just promises.

We’re already making parts of the tech live—exclusively for DAO holders. The code ok Github is intentionally scoped to showcase M101D’s core features without exposing sensitive or proprietary elements.


Our goal: transparency, usability, and community-driven growth. The files are open for anyone to run, explore, and build with.

Let’s Build together in public.
